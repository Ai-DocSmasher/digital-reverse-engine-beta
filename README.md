Digital Reverse Engine™ (DRE) — Master Edition [v1.3.0]The definitive deterministic structural audio reversal workstation.Digital Reverse Engine™ isn’t just a "reverse" effect; it is a structural audio processor designed to flip audio while maintaining musical phrasing, grid alignment, and rhythmic integrity. Perfect for AI music creators, sound designers, and professional producers.🚀 Why v1.3.0 "Master Edition"?The v1.3.0 update marks the transition from a CLI-first utility to a fully-fledged professional GUI workstation.Structural Integrity: Unlike standard DAW "reverse" functions that just flip the sample, DRE uses patent-pending structural logic to keep your audio musically coherent.Pro-Visual Engine: High-resolution waveform ruler with 0:00 to End time markers and "Glider-Zoom" inspection.Intelligent Analysis: Integrated Librosa beat-tracking automatically detects track BPM for instant grid alignment.Live Monitoring: Integrated sounddevice playback engine with a synchronized visual metronome.🎛 Reverse ModesModeBest ForDescriptionTRUE REVERSEStandard FXClassic sample-flipping for traditional reverse sounds.HQ REVERSEVocals / LeadsHigh-fidelity structural reversal with optimized transients.TATUM REVERSEPercussionMicro-structural flips based on the smallest rhythmic units.STUDIO MODEFull TracksThe ultimate structural engine for flipping entire 4-bar or 8-bar phrases.📦 Installation & Quick StartFor Producers (No Python Required)Download the latest DRE_Master.zip from [Releases].Extract and run DRE_Master.exe.Load your audio, let the engine detect the BPM, and hit Start Engine.For Developers (Python Environment)Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-repo/digital-reverse-engine.git
