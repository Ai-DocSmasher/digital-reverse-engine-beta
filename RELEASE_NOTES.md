This release introduces HQ_REVERSE, a fully offline, tempo‑aware structural
reverse mode designed for clarity, musicality, and modern DSP workflows.

- TRANSIENTAWARE_REVERSE — tatum‑like micro‑segment reverse
- DJ_REVERSE — 1/8‑beat slicing for rhythmic effects
- STUDIO_REVERSE — bar‑level structural reverse

## 🎧 Improvements
- smoother transitions
- stereo‑safe reconstruction
- deterministic slicing
- improved tempo fallback logic
